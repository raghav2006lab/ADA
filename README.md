## Backtracking


Backtracking is a powerful algorithmic paradigm used to solve problems by exploring all possible solutions. It works by building solutions incrementally and abandoning a solution as soon as it is determined that it cannot be completed to a valid solution. This makes backtracking a more efficient way of solving problems than brute-force.

### Characteristics of Backtracking:
1. *Recursive Structure*: Backtracking problems are typically solved recursively.
2. *Pruning*: Infeasible solutions are discarded early, reducing the search space.
3. *Choice Tree*: Backtracking problems can be represented as a decision tree where each branch corresponds to a decision.

### Algorithms Using Backtracking

#### 1. *N-Queens Problem*
The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This problem is commonly solved using backtracking, where each queen is placed on the board one by one, and we backtrack when an invalid position is reached.

- *Time Complexity:* Worst-case time complexity for the backtracking solution is O(N!), where N is the number of queens (or the size of the chessboard).
- *Space Complexity:* The space complexity is O(N) because:
We need to maintain a list of size N to store the positions of the queens (in a 1D array or list, where each index represents a row and the value at the index represents the column of the queen).
Additionally, recursive calls will consume extra space on the call stack, which adds O(N) to the space complexity.


#### 2. *2. Graph Coloring Problem*
Graph Coloring is the process of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. This is a classic backtracking problem used to solve problems like scheduling and register allocation.
- *Time Complexity:* Worst-case time complexity for backtracking-based graph coloring is O(m^n), where:
n is the number of vertices in the graph.
m is the number of colors available.
This is because, in the worst case, for each vertex, you might try all m colors, and you have n vertices to color. Thus, the backtracking search explores all possible color assignments.
- *Space Complexity:* The space complexity is O(n) for storing the color assignments and the graph itself (if represented with an adjacency list or matrix). This includes:
  O(n) for storing the colors of the vertices.
  O(n + e) for storing the graph itself, where e is the number of edges.
  The call stack for the recursive backtracking algorithm also contributes to the space complexity, which would be O(n) in the worst case.
